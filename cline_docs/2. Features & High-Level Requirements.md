2. Features & High-Level Requirements

2.1 Authentication & Authorization
	1.	Login:
	•	Users can log in with their email either by:
	•	Magic Link (Supabase default flow).
	•	Password (Supabase Email+Password flow).
	•	Admin accounts are pre-seeded in Supabase.
	•	Patients are created by an admin in the “Patients” section.
	2.	Roles:
	•	Admin: Full CRUD on patients, reports, calendar events.
	•	Patient: Read-only access to their own reports (and optionally, the shared calendar).

Future Enhancement:
	•	Additional roles (e.g., “Doctor,” “Super Admin,” etc.).
	•	Shareable public link for certain reports.

2.2 Admin Dashboard

Accessible only by admins upon login. The sidebar should have:
	1.	Patients
	•	View all patients (table + filters + search).
	•	Create patient, edit patient, delete patient.
	2.	Reports
	•	View all reports (admin can see all).
	•	Create a new report linked to a patient.
	•	Edit or delete existing reports.
	3.	Calendar
	•	View a monthly/weekly/daily calendar with events.
	•	Create, edit, or delete events.
	•	Each event can be associated with a patient.

2.3 Patient Dashboard

Accessible by patients upon login. The sidebar (or minimal top-level nav) should have:
	1.	My Reports
	•	List of all the reports associated with this logged-in patient.
	•	Ability to view detail of each report (read-only).
	2.	Calendar (optional, read-only)
	•	If decided, the patient sees a calendar of all events. (Per current requirement, all events are visible; a future iteration could limit to only their own events.)

2.4 Reports Functionality
	1.	Report Fields
	•	Example (expand as needed):
	•	patient_id (FK to patients)
	•	diagnosis (text, required)
	•	summary (text, optional or required depending on use case)
	•	attachments (array of URLs or references to storage if needed)
	•	created_at (auto)
	•	created_by (FK to user_id from Supabase auth.users or a local users table)
	•	Admin can create/edit reports. Patient can view only.
	2.	Sharing Reports (Future)
	•	Option to generate a one-time “shareable link” that grants read-only access to a specific report.
	•	Access logs or auditing would track link usage (future).

2.5 Calendar Functionality
	1.	Calendar Display
	•	Monthly or weekly view toggles.
	•	Highlight current day.
	•	Navigate between months/weeks.
	•	Show events as blocks on the correct day/time range.
	2.	Event Fields
	•	title (e.g., “Consultation”)
	•	description (optional)
	•	start_time (datetime)
	•	end_time (datetime)
	•	patient_id (optional FK; if the event is tied to a specific patient)
	•	admin_id (FK to the admin who created it or “owner” of the event)
	•	created_at, updated_at
	3.	Event Actions
	•	Create: Admin clicks on a date/time to open a sheet/modal for event creation.
	•	Edit/Delete: Admin can modify or remove events.
	•	Read-Only: Patients can see events (for simplicity all events are visible) but cannot modify them.

2.6 Localization / Internationalization
	1.	Language Toggle
	•	The app defaults to English.
	•	A global toggle (or user setting) to switch to Spanish.
	•	All UI strings should be internationalized (e.g., using next-intl, react-i18next, or similar).
	2.	Content Localization:
	•	The actual data (reports, event descriptions) may be in Spanish or English, but the UI labels should adapt.

2.7 Future Features (Not in MVP, but planned)
	1.	Notifications:
	•	Email notifications or in-app notifications when new reports are created.
	2.	Auditing:
	•	Log who created/edited/deleted patients, reports, events.
	•	Possibly store revision history.
	3.	Shareable Reports:
	•	One-click link that a patient can share with relatives.
