7. Future Considerations.md

	1.	Notifications:
	•	Send emails via Supabase functions or a third-party (SendGrid, etc.) when a new report is created.
	2.	Auditing & Logging:
	•	Additional table audit_logs or direct references in each table’s created_by, updated_by.
	3.	Shareable Report Links:
	•	Generate unique tokens (UUID or short link) to grant read-only access.
	•	Store in a shared_links table that references report_id.
	4.	Performance & Scalability:
	•	For ~200 patients, a simple table approach + pagination is sufficient.
	•	For more than a few thousand records, consider indexing on relevant columns (patients.email, reports.patient_id, etc.).
