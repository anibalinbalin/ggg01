10. Open Questions / Confirmations.md

	1.	Attachments Storage: Will you store files in Supabase Storage or an external bucket (S3)?
	2.	Patient Creation Flow: After an admin adds a patient’s email, do we auto-trigger a magic link invite, or do we wait for them to log in themselves?
	3.	Calendar: For MVP, all events are visible to all. In future, we might limit patients to only see events they’re assigned to.
	4.	Localization: Are you okay with storing dictionary in code, or do you prefer something dynamic?

(These questions can be refined once the team starts implementing.)
