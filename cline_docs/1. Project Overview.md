1. Project Overview

Project Name:
Patient-Report Management (React, Next.js, Shadcn/UI, Supabase)

Objective:
Provide a web application where:
	1.	Admins can create and manage patients, create reports, and schedule appointments via a shared calendar.
	2.	Patients can log in (via magic link or password) to view their reports (and optionally see scheduled events in the calendar).
	3.	The application supports a bilingual interface (English/Spanish), with user-specific or global language toggles.
	4.	Future expansions include notifications, additional user roles, and shareable links for certain reports (e.g., a read-only view for relatives).

Key Points:
	•	Single-tenant system with multiple admins (no multi-tenant requirement).
	•	Uses Supabase for authentication, row-level security, and database.
	•	Follows best practices for SQL naming conventions (snake_case, singular column names, etc.).
	•	Leverages Next.js 15+ App Router, Server Actions, TypeScript, and Shadcn/UI (Tailwind + Radix).
